1) Most interviewers are on your side and want to see you perform well.
2) Prepare a short and concise introduction.
3) Be ready to discuss technical aspects of your projects in detail.
4) Understanding the problem well is the first step during interviews.
5) Never jump straight to the solution and start coding.
6) Ask clarifying questions about the problem and the constraints.
7) Never assume things which are not given in the problem.
8) Identify edge cases early on and design your solution accordingly.
9) Run through few input/output examples.
10) Itâ€™s ok to use pen and paper during the interview.
11) Pick a programming language you are most comfortable with.

20) Brainstorm which data structure is best suited for the problem.
21) Discuss the time and space complexity of your approach.
22) Start coding only when you're clear on what to write.
23) Don't just code, communicate.
24) Dry run few input/output examples to check for correctness.
25) Use meaningful variable names.
26) Write clean, readable and modular code.
27) Implement the core logic first and utility methods in the end.
28) Write tests to validate your solution.
29) Make sure your solution works for edge/boundary cases.
